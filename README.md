# Misión TIC 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the challenges of the Misión TIC 2022 formation program in Programming Skills.

## About [Misión TIC 2022](https://www.misiontic2022.gov.co/)

Misión TIC 2022 is a program of the Colombian Ministry of ICT with the objective of training 100,000 Colombian youth and adults in programming skills. This training is carried out in conjunction with 10 universities nationwide, in my particular case the Sergio Arboleda University, in Bogotá.

The program consists of 4 cycles of 200 hours, in 7 weeks each cycle, mainly focused on programming, accompanied by English classes and coaching sessions focused on soft skills.

The approval criteria for each cycle consist of programming challenges (80%), evaluated in an automated way and supervised by the course tutors, and English challenges (20%).

## DISCLAMER

This repository is intended just to share my own solution to the problem sets. Remember that the main goal is to improve your coding abilities, so first try to solve the problems yourself. The evaluation software has copy prevention and may lead to penalties.

## Content

The description of the challenges (problem sets) and comments in the code are in Spanish as it is the main language of the Misión TIC 2022 program.

Even with previous studies, I solve all the challenges with the progression of the topics according to the classes.
